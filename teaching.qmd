## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in making complex political science concepts accessible through hands-on learning and real-world applications. My teaching emphasizes the intersection of theory and practice, particularly in quantitative methods and comparative politics, drawing from my research experience in computational social science and political violence.

## Teaching Materials & Resources

### Quantitative Methods Resources

-   [Tutorial 1: Getting Started with Greek Notation and Descriptive Stats](/tutorial1.qmd)

### Student Mentorship

I have extensive experience mentoring student researchers, having supervised **34 undergraduate and graduate research assistants** and **15 independent projects** since 2019-2025. 

At CU, I currently supervise four undergradaute RAs. They provide qualitative coding and research assistance for a long-term project aiming to better understand apocalyptic language on social media. 

At Middlebury, I oversaw projects covering topics such as:

-   Italian neofascism and political violence
-   Militant accelerationism and coalition-building
-   French far-right movements on encrypted platforms
-   AI implications for domestic counterterrorism
-   Christian identity movements in contemporary extremism

## Research-Teaching Integration

My courses integrate cutting-edge research methods with substantive political science questions. Students learn to:

-   Apply computational methods to political phenomena
-   Critically evaluate digital media and online communities
-   Understand the methodological challenges of studying sensitive political topics
-   Connect theoretical frameworks to empirical analysis
