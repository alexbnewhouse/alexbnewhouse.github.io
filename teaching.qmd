## Teaching Philosophy

My approach centers on **active learning**, **methodological rigor**, and **practical application**â€”helping students develop both theoretical understanding and technical skills they can apply to pressing societal challenges.

I believe in making complex political science concepts accessible through hands-on learning and real-world applications, particularly in quantitative methods and comparative politics.

## Research-Teaching Integration

My courses integrate cutting-edge research methods with substantive political science questions. Students learn to:

-   **Apply computational methods** to real political phenomena using Python, R, and specialized software
-   **Critically evaluate** digital media, online communities, and algorithmic systems\
-   **Navigate ethical challenges** of studying sensitive political topics
-   **Connect theoretical frameworks** to empirical analysis through hands-on projects
-   **Develop professional skills** in data visualization, statistical analysis, and research communication

**Signature Approach:** Each course includes substantial research components where students collect and analyze original data, preparing them for graduate study or professional research roles.
