This should be pretty familiar for you, you likely know intuitively that the average of \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 2\\).\nShown below is how this looks in code. I first generate 500 random values and store them as a column in a dataframe. Then, I print the mean of that column. Last, I create a histogram of the values and show the mean wtih a red line.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ Attaching core tidyverse packages ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ tidyverse 2.0.0 ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n‚úî dplyr     1.1.4     ‚úî readr     2.1.5\n‚úî forcats   1.0.0     ‚úî stringr   1.5.1\n‚úî ggplot2   3.5.2     ‚úî tibble    3.3.0\n‚úî lubridate 1.9.4     ‚úî tidyr     1.3.1\n‚úî purrr     1.1.0     \n‚îÄ‚îÄ Conflicts ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ tidyverse_conflicts() ‚îÄ‚îÄ\n‚úñ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n‚úñ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n‚Ñπ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nset.seed(1234)\n# simulate 500 values and store as a vector in a dataframe\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(500))\n\n# print the mean\nmean(df$x)\n\n[1] 0.001838821\n\n# graph the histogram and show the mean line (in red)\ndf %&gt;% \n    ggplot() + \n    geom_histogram(aes(x = x)) + \n    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(x)), color = \"red\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

And, indeed, if we do the basic ‚Äúadd up all the values and divide by the number of values‚Äù, you‚Äôll get the same value:\n\nsum_x = sum(df$x)\nsum_x / length(df$x)\n\n[1] 0.001838821\n\n\nWhat does this look like in Greek notation? Let‚Äôs take a look:\n\\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}\\]\nDespite the fact that you‚Äôre probably comfortable with the concept of mean, there are a lot of symbols here to describe that concept. It can be daunting! But we can break it down and show that it really isn‚Äôt that bad.\n\\(\\mathbb{E}[X]\\) is how we symbolize ‚ÄúExpected Value of X‚Äù; in this case, we‚Äôre using X to refer to our whole set of values (the vector containing all of the numbers that we want to find the mean of). Expected value, remember, just means ‚Äúmean‚Äù.\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) symbolizes a summation. The sigma \\(\\sum\\) is the greek symbol for ‚Äúadd all of the elements together‚Äù. The \\(i\\) below the sigma indicates that we‚Äôre going to start at the first element of our data. The \\(n\\) above the sigma indicates that we‚Äôre going to use all of the data up to the last value. \\(X_i\\) refers to the \\(i\\)-th element of X, our vector holding all of the values that we want to average.\nTo put it together, we‚Äôre summing every value from \\(X_1\\) to \\(X_n\\), and then we‚Äôre dividing that by \\(n\\). In this case, our \\(X\\) vector is the data that we simulated, and we‚Äôre going to go from \\(X_1\\) to \\(X_{500}\\) (since we created 500 values in our original code)."

Think how long the tails on the left and right of the mean are.\nFinding variance in code is easy:\n\nvar(df$x)\n\n[1] 1.07084\n\n\nWhat does a higher or lower variance actually mean? Let‚Äôs investigate. We‚Äôre going to create two new vectors/columns: a high variance one (var = 4) and a low variance one (var = .25). Note: the code we use to generate this asks for standard deviation, which is just the square root of the variance.\nAfter adding a ‚Äúhigh_var‚Äù and a ‚Äúlow_var‚Äù column to our data frame, we then create a histogram showing the different columns on the same graph. Our high-variance data is shown in blue, our original data is shown in orange, and our low-variance data is shown in green.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance in Greek notation is pretty similar to that of the mean‚Äìin fact, mean and variance are linked mathematically, too! The variance equation is depicted by:\n\\[\\text{Var(X)} = \\sigma^2 = s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\mu)^2}{n-1}\\]\nLet‚Äôs walk through it piece by piece. First, \\(\\text{Var(X)}, \\sigma^2, \\text{and } s^2\\) are all different ways of saying ‚Äúvariance of X‚Äù. Second, now we have a slightly different summation than what‚Äôs in the equation for mean. \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\mu)^2\\) is depicting how we are summing (\\(\\sum\\)) from our first element (\\(i=1\\)) to our \\(n\\)-th element for the value \\((X_i - \\mu)^2\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is simply the mean of \\(X\\). Intuitively, this is finding the sum of all of the distances (squared) between a single value \\(X_i\\) and the mean of all of the values. Last, we divide that summed value by \\(n-1\\).\nNote that variance includes mean as part of its equation. You can literally take the mean we calculated above and plug it into this function and find the right value! Let‚Äôs see how that looks:\n\nvar(df$x)\n\n[1] 1.07084\n\nmean_x &lt;- mean(df$x)\nsum_squared_distance &lt;- sum((df$x - mean_x)^2)\nvar_calc = sum_squared_distance/(length(df$x)-1)\nvar_calc\n\n[1] 1.07084\n\n\nSo the variance of a sample is a function of the mean of that sample."
