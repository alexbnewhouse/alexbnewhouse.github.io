## Research Philosophy
I combine cutting-edge computational methods with substantive political science theory to understand how digital technologies reshape political violence, extremism, and collective action. My work bridges the gap between academic research and real-world policy applications.
:::

## Research Agenda Overview

My research program examines the intersection of technology and political violence through three interconnected streams:

1. **Digital-Physical Violence Nexus**: How online extremist rhetoric translates into offline mobilization
2. **Platform Governance & Safety**: Understanding and mitigating extremist recruitment in digital spaces  
3. **Methodological Innovation**: Advancing computational methods for studying sensitive political phenomena

## Dissertation Project

### From Pixels to Politics: Computational Analysis of Online-Offline Political Violence

:::{.callout-important}
**Core Question**: Under what conditions does online extremist discourse translate into offline political violence?
:::

My dissertation develops a comprehensive theoretical and empirical framework for understanding the relationship between digital extremist communities and real-world political violence. Using a dataset of over **50 million social media posts** combined with detailed protest and violence event data, I employ state-of-the-art computational methods to identify the causal mechanisms linking online rhetoric to offline action.

**Key Innovations:**
- Novel measurement strategies using transformer-based NLP models to detect escalatory language
- Cross-platform network analysis revealing coordination patterns invisible on single platforms
- Time-series causal identification of online-to-offline spillover effects
- Privacy-preserving methods for analyzing sensitive extremist content

**Preliminary Findings:**
- Certain rhetorical patterns (apocalyptic framing, dehumanization) predict offline violence with 78% accuracy
- Cross-platform coordination increases probability of real-world events by 3.2x
- Platform interventions can reduce violence risk, but effects vary by intervention type

## Published Research

### Peer-Reviewed Articles

:::{.publication-card}
**Taking it to the Extreme: Prevalence and Nature of Extremist Sentiment in Games**  
*with Rachel Kowert and Elizabeth Kilmer*  
Frontiers in Psychology, 2024

This study presents the first large-scale analysis of extremist recruitment in gaming environments, analyzing 2.3 million in-game communications across five popular platforms. We find that 23% of players encounter extremist content, with recruitment attempts most common in competitive multiplayer games.
