## Research Overview

My research program sits at the intersection of **computational social science**, **political violence**, and **technology studies**. I develop and apply cutting-edge computational methods—machine learning, natural language processing, and social network analysis—to understand how online communities translate into offline political action.

**Core Questions:**
- How do digital platforms facilitate political radicalization and mobilization?
- What role do emerging technologies play in extremist recruitment and organization?  
- How can computational methods help us understand and counter political violence?

## Featured Publications

### Peer-Reviewed Articles

**Kowert, R., Kilmer, E., and Newhouse, A.** (2024). "Taking it to the Extreme: Prevalence and Nature of Extremist Sentiment in Games." [*Frontiers in Psychology*](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1410620/full), 15:1410620.

This study addresses the gap in research knowledge around extremist sentiment in games by evaluating prevalence, location, nature, and impact through an online survey of 423 game players, revealing alarmingly high rates of extremist content exposure and normalization within gaming cultures.

- **Funded by:** Department of Homeland Security (DHS # EMW-2022-GR-00036)
- **Key Finding:** More than half of all game players report experiencing some form of hate, harassment or abuse within gaming spaces, with extremist rhetoric becoming culturally normalized

**Newhouse, A.** (2021). "The Threat is the Network: The Multi-Node Structure of Neo-Fascist Accelerationism." [*CTC Sentinel*](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-threat-is-the-network-the-multi-node-structure-of-neo-fascist-accelerationism/), 14(5).

Since 2015, the Atomwaffen Division has received bulk academic and media attention in coverage of the neo-fascist accelerationist movement, but evidence reveals it was not the apex of a hierarchy but rather one node in a larger network of violent accelerationists built on membership fluidity, frequent communications, and a shared goal of social destruction.

- **Innovation:** Novel network-based framework for understanding extremist movements
- **Policy Impact:** Enforcement against individuals and groups is necessary but not sufficient—focus on specific groups may not tackle the root of the issue
- **Citations:** Extensively cited in terrorism studies and cited in recent *Studies in Conflict & Terrorism* article

**McGuffie, K. and Newhouse, A.** (2020). "The Radicalization Risks of GPT-3 and Advanced Neural Language Models." [*arXiv preprint*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06807), 2009.06807.

We show GPT-3's strength in generating text that accurately emulates interactive, informational, and influential content that could be utilized for radicalizing individuals into violent far-right extremist ideologies and behaviors. While OpenAI's preventative measures are strong, the possibility of unregulated copycat technology represents significant risk for large-scale online radicalization and recruitment.

- **Impact:** 28 citations and featured in major tech policy discussions
- **Media Coverage:** Extensive coverage in *The Register*, *Vice*, and other tech outlets
- **Policy Influence:** Already in 2020, Kris McGuffie and Alex Newhouse highlighted the potential for abuse of generative language models by assessing GPT-3, revealing significant risk for large-scale online radicalization and recruitment

**Newhouse, A.** (2020). "Parler is bringing together mainstream conservatives, anti-Semites and white supremacists as the social media platform attracts millions of Trump supporters." *The Conversation*. 

- **Impact:** 241,000 views for Parler analysis

**Multiple GNET Research Reports** (2021-2022) on accelerationist movements and extremist narratives, including analysis of the Great Replacement theory and Boogaloo movement.
