## About

I am a **PhD candidate in Political Science** at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in computational analysis of political violence and extremism. My research develops and applies cutting-edge methods—machine learning, natural language processing, and social network analysis—to understand how online communities translate into offline political action.

**Key Experience:**

- **Investigative Consultant** to the House Select Committee on January 6th  
- **Deputy Director** of the Center on Terrorism, Extremism & Counterterrorism
- **Principal Investigator** on $1.38M in federal research grants
- **Research partnerships** with major technology companies
